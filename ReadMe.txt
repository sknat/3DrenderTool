Delphi 3D Render tool
=========

This is an old delphi project that I did in highschool,

* Moteur contains the principal unit (d3d.pas) and a simple project (only for tests)
* ModelsEdit is the core project, the 3D shape editor who are stored in Models.
* Models contains 3D models.
* Launcher, a dropdown list allowing you to launch other projects. (Doesn't work very well)
* Games are still under developpement (Highschool is far :D)

Licence
=======
This software is distributed under GPL3 licence.
Original Author is Nathan Skrzypczak

 
Issues
======
* A real rendering algorithm because the one used actually deforms perspectives
* Handling forms behind camera -> create child class from Tcanvas
